#Euscite. The eusocial site for collaborative scientific research

## Web app project created using React.js

Deployed in heroku: https://euscite.herokuapp.com/

###Description

The main idea behind this project was to create a site that would remember GitHub in many ways, but focused in the scientific world.

React does the heavy lifting in this web app, while Draft.js and Chart.js were used as fundation of the post creation tool.

The app includes an API back that takes care of the login and DB management.

###Main goal

Being Euscite my first big React project, the goal was to see how far I could go in the limited time I had before showing the final product in the Ironhack's course closure day.
